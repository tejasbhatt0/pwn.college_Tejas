# Intro to Arguments
To use and learn about the echo command.

## My solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{MskzVOms05i0bwpnzZM47tO--iI.QX4YjM1wiN2gjNzEzW}

I wrote the echo command with an argument. It gave me back my argument. Then I wrote "hello" with the argument "hackers" to get the flag.

```bash
echo Hello Hackers!
hello hackers
```

## What I learned
The echo command takes an argument and then throws the argument back up as the output.
