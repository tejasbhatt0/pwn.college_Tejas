# Position thy self
I learned to run specific command from specific directories to invoke them correctly.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{helloworld}`
I first went to the root directory to see what was present there. Upon listing the contents, I saw the challenge directory. I went there using cd and saw that it contained DESCREPTION.md and the run file. Then i tried to invoke the run file like usual, but it told me that I was incorrect and gave me a directory to go to to invoke the command. I then went to /usr/share/build-essential and then invoked the /challenge/run command, at which point it gave me my flag.

```bash
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ cd /
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/$ ls
bin   challenge  etc   home  lib32  libx32  mnt  opt   root  sbin  sys  usr
boot  dev        flag  lib   lib64  media   nix  proc  run   srv   tmp  var
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/$ cd /challenge
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/challenge$ ls
DESCRIPTION.md  run
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/challenge$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /usr/share/build-essential directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/challenge$ cd
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ cd /usr/share/build-essential
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/usr/share/build-essential$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{8iCfYdQyZk0iaRqkrYzcjki_daD.QX2QTN0wiN2gjNzEzW}
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/usr/share/build-essential$
```

## What I learned
I learned how to traverse directories using the cd command with the agrument of an absolute path.

## Incorrect tangents
Directly tried to invoke the /challenge/run command. Then when it didn't work at first, I went to the challenge directory using cd /challenge and listed it's contents. I found the run file, but upon invoking it, it also told me that I was incorrect.
