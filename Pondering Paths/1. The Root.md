# The Root
The challenge expects us to understand how a file system in Linux works.

## My solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{oijQe5GdQFdtLFBEhm4ySFUjbZp.QX4cTO0wiN2gjNzEzW}

It teaches about what a absolute path is. / is the root directory. Any path that begins with a / (i.e. starts from the root) is known as the absolute path. Thus, as instructed, I invoked /pwn and it gave me the flag

```bash
hacker@paths~the-root:~$ /pwn
BOOM!!!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{oijQe5GdQFdtLFBEhm4ySFUjbZp.QX4cTO0wiN2gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learned about the root directory and what an absolute path of a file or directory is.

## Incorrect tangents
