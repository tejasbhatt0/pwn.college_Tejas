# Grepping for a needle in a haystack
The challenge expects us to learn how to use the grep command to find strings in a file.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{gKTUemPFBMLBSM_qf_92WSfEgla.QX3EDO0wiN2gjNzEzW}`
I used the "grep" command with the string "pwn.college" as the first argument (since all flags start with pwn.college) and "/challenge/data.txt" as the second argument.


```bash
hacker@commands~grepping-for-a-needle-in-a-haystack:~$ grep pwn.college /challenge/data.txt
pwn.college{gKTUemPFBMLBSM_qf_92WSfEgla.QX3EDO0wiN2gjNzEzW}
```
