# Removing Files
The challenge teaches us how to remove files using the "rm" command.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{UIilbtbliaHFJDcW0cXW6lu5EqG.QX2kDM1wiN2gjNzEzW}`
I first listed the contents of the home directory, and found the delete_me file. Then I deleted it using the "rm delete_me" command. Them I got the flag by invoking "/challenge/run".

```bash
hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ ls
 Desktop   delete_me   key   key.pub  '~'
hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ rm delete_me
hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ ls
 Desktop   key   key.pub  '~'
hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ /challenge/check
Excellent removal. Here is your reward:
pwn.college{UIilbtbliaHFJDcW0cXW6lu5EqG.QX2kDM1wiN2gjNzEzW}
