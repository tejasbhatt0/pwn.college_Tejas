# Catting Absolute Paths
To learn that the "cat" command can also accept the absolute path of a file as it's argument to read it.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{cx35msVpG-vkQ1ihHCAdjvQzaSh.QX5ETO0wiN2gjNzEzW}`

Invoked "cat" command with the the absolute path to the flag "/flag" as it's argument.

```bash
hacker@commands~catting-absolute-paths:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{cx35msVpG-vkQ1ihHCAdjvQzaSh.QX5ETO0wiN2gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learned that the "cat" command can also be invoked by using the file's absolute path as it's argument.
